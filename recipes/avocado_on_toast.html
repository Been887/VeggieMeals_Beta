            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>Avocado on toast is not just a trendy breakfast choice, but also a healthy one. Packed with monounsaturated fats, avocados are heart-friendly and can help reduce bad cholesterol levels. They're also rich in fiber, which aids digestion, and contain a variety of vitamins and minerals like potassium, vitamin E, and vitamin C. When paired with whole grain toast, this dish provides a balanced meal that can keep you feeling full and energized throughout the day. Additionally, avocados are known for their anti-inflammatory properties and can contribute to better skin health.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Picture this: a perfectly ripe avocado, sliced or mashed, and spread generously over a slice of warm, crunchy toast. The vibrant green contrasts beautifully with the earthy brown of the toast. To elevate the flavors, you can add a sprinkle of sea salt, a dash of red pepper flakes, or a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Some even like to top it with a poached egg or a handful of cherry tomatoes for an extra layer of taste and nutrition. It's a simple yet delightful dish that can be customized to suit your taste preferences. Enjoy!</p>
